# ORPHANED TidalCycles Arch Support Branch

It is unfortunately not possible to support arch when it will allow packaging installation without adequately specifying dependencies (yes, you can cleanly install a package via `pacman` then have it fail to start because of missing dependencies)

Leaving this here in case anyone else wishes to try and take on the support.
